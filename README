ami-creator

A simple tool based on python-imgcreate to create Fedora/Red Hat style 
images that can be used as an AMI in EC2.

Takes a kickstart config like the rest of livecd-creator, etc and spits out a
disk image file that's suitable to upload as an s3 ami.  To do the upload right
now, you'll want to run something like
    ec2-bundle-image
    ec2-upload-bundle
    ec2-register
after having created your base image file.  

Tested with the following as guests:
  * CentOS 5.5
  * Fedora 14
See the configs/ directory for example configs that work for each of these.
